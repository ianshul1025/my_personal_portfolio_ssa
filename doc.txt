HTML Fundamentals Assignment - Documentation

1. What each HTML element does:

1.1 <header>  
This is used to create the top part of the page, like a title area.

1.2 <nav>  
This tag is used to make a navigation menu with links to other pages.

1.3 <main>  
It defines the main content area of the page.

1.4 <section>  
Used to divide the page into different sections for better structure.

1.5 <footer>  
This appears at the bottom and usually has copyright or other info.

1.6 <h1> to <h6>  
These are headings from biggest (h1) to smallest (h6) to organize content.

1.7 <ul>, <ol>, <li>  
Used to create lists. I used <ul> for listing my skills and <ol> for education history.

1.8 <img>  
To display images with alt text for accessibility and better SEO.

1.9 <table>  
For showing data in rows and columns. I used it for listing work or projects.

1.10 <tr>  
To create rows inside a table.

1.11 <th>  
To create header cells in the table (like column titles).

1.12 <form>  
Used to collect user input on the contact page.

1.13 <input>  
Used for various fields like text, email, tel, date, range, etc.

1.14 <textarea>  
For longer messages or feedback in the form.

1.15 <select>  
To give a dropdown with multiple options to choose from.

1.16 <a>  
Used to create hyperlinks to other pages or external websites.

1.17 <br>  
Breaks a line without starting a new paragraph.

1.18 <p>  
Used to create and separate paragraphs of text.


2. Why I chose specific input types:

2.1 I used text input for name as it’s for basic text entry.

2.2 Email input helps the user enter a valid email address.

2.3 Tel input is for mobile numbers and works well with patterns.

2.4 Date input makes it easier for the user to pick a date from a calendar.

2.5 Range is useful for selecting values from a scale (like rating 1–10).

2.6 Checkboxes are used when the user can select multiple options.

2.7 Radio buttons are used when only one option should be selected.

2.8 Textarea is used for longer messages or comments.

2.9 Select is used for dropdowns where only one option needs to be selected.


3. How my navigation structure works:

3.1 I added a <nav> tag at the top of each page to hold the navigation menu.

3.2 The menu has links to the three main pages: Home (portfolio.html), About (about.html), and Contact (contact.html).

3.3 This helps users move easily from one page to another.

3.4 On the About page, I also added an external link that opens in a new tab.
