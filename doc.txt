HTML Fundamentals Assignment - Documentation

1. What each HTML element does:

<header> – This is used to create the top part of the page, like a title area.  
<nav> – This tag is used to make a navigation menu with links to other pages.  
<main> – It defines the main content area of the page.  
<section> – Used to divide the page into different sections for better structure.  
<footer> – This appears at the bottom and usually has copyright or other info.  
<h1> to <h6> – These are headings from biggest (h1) to smallest (h6) to organize content.  
<ul>, <ol>, <li> – Used to create lists. I used <ul> for skills and <ol> for education.  
<img> – To display images with alt text for accessibility.  
<table> – For showing data in rows and columns. I used it for projects.
<tr> – To make rows inside a table.  
<th> – To create header cells in the table (like column titles). 
<form> – Used to collect input from users on the contact page.  
<input> – Different types used like text, email, tel, date, range etc.  
<textarea> – For longer messages in the form.  
<select> – To give dropdown options to choose from.  
<a> – Used to create links to other pages or websites.
<br> – To break the line without starting a new paragraph.  
<p> – To create separate paragraphs of text.  


2. Why you chose specific input types:

- I used text input for name as it's basic text.  
- Email input makes sure the user types a valid email address.  
- Tel input is for phone numbers and allows using a pattern.  
- Date input makes it easy to select a date.  
- Range is for rating or level from 1 to 10.  
- Checkboxes are used when more than one option can be selected.  
- Radio buttons are used when only one option should be selected.  
- Textarea is used for long messages.  
- Select is for dropdown choices (like topic selection).

3. How your navigation structure works:

I added a <nav> tag on every page. It has links to the Home (portfolio.html),  
About (about.html), and Contact (contact.html) pages.  
This helps users move between pages easily.  
Also, on the About page, I added one external link that opens in a new tab.
